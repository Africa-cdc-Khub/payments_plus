echo "🔍 DEBUGGING STEPS:\n";
echo "==================\n";
echo "1. Open registration_lookup.php in browser\n";
echo "2. Search for registrations\n";
echo "3. Click 'Complete Payment' on any pending registration\n";
echo "4. Check if it redirects to payment page or shows error\n\n";

echo "If you see 'Registration not found or payment not required':\n";
echo "- Check if the registration ID exists\n";
echo "- Check if payment_status is 'pending'\n";
echo "- Check if the URL parameters are correct\n\n";

echo "If you see 'Invalid payment link':\n";
echo "- Check if the token is stored in database\n";
echo "- Check if the token matches what's expected\n";
echo "- Check if the registration exists\n\n";

echo "✅ BACKEND TESTS PASSED:\n";
echo "- Registration lookup working\n";
echo "- Payment action logic working\n";
echo "- Payment token generation working\n";
echo "- Payment page loads successfully\n\n";

echo "The issue is likely in the web interface or URL handling.\n";
