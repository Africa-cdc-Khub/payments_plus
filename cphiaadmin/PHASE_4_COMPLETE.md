## **Data Flow**

### **List Page Flow:**
```
1. User opens list page (e.g., /admin/registrations)
2. Blade view loads with filters
3. JavaScript/DataTables makes AJAX call to API
4. API route → API Controller
5. Controller queries database with filters
6. Data returned as JSON
7. DataTables renders table
8. User interacts (filter, search, paginate)
9. Process repeats with new parameters
```

### **Export Flow:**
```
1. User clicks "Export" button
2. JavaScript collects current filters
3. Redirects to /api/{module}/export with filters
4. API Controller queries database
5. Maatwebsite/Excel generates file
6. File downloaded to user's computer
7. Filename includes timestamp
```

### **Update Flow (Payment/Attendance):**
```
1. User clicks "Update" button
2. Modal opens with current status
3. User selects new status
4. AJAX PUT request to API
5. Controller validates & updates database
6. Success response returned
7. Table refreshes with new data
8. Alert shown to user
```

## **Known Limitations**

### **To Be Implemented (Phase 5+):**
1. **Registration Details:** Currently using placeholder - needs full implementation with database query
2. **Payment Details:** Placeholder view - needs full details page
3. **User Details:** Placeholder view - needs full participant details
4. **Admin Edit:** Modal ready but edit functionality needs completion
5. **Reports Module:** Placeholder - full PDF/Excel report generation
6. **Settings Module:** Placeholder - system configuration interface

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. Real-time notifications (WebSockets)
2. Bulk actions (bulk status updates)
3. Advanced search (multiple criteria)
4. Data visualization (more charts)
5. Activity logging (audit trail)
6. Email notifications (status changes)
7. PDF generation (invoices, reports)
8. API rate limiting
9. Cache optimization
10. Background jobs (exports)

---

## **Performance Considerations**

✅ **Optimizations Applied:**
- Eager loading relationships (`with()`)
- Pagination on all lists
- AJAX loading (no full page refresh)
- CDN-hosted assets
- Efficient database queries
- Client-side DataTables processing

🔄 **Future Optimizations:**
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Queue system for exports
- Database indexing
- API response caching
- Lazy loading for large datasets

---

## **Security Features**

✅ **Implemented:**
- CSRF protection on all forms
- API token authentication (Sanctum)
- Role-based access control (Spatie)
- Permission middleware on routes
- SQL injection prevention (PDO)
- XSS protection (Blade escaping)
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Self-action prevention (can't delete/deactivate self)
