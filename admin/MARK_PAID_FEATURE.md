# Mark Paid Feature

## Overview
Admin and Finance users can now manually mark registrations as paid, with full tracking of who performed the action and detailed remarks about the payment.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
**Migration:** `2025_10_09_070025_add_manual_payment_tracking_to_payments_table.php`

Added to `payments` table:
- `completed_by` (nullable int) - Stores the admin ID who marked the payment as paid
- `manual_payment_remarks` (nullable text) - Stores notes about the manual payment

### 2. Backend Implementation

**Updated Models:**
- **Payment Model** (`app/Models/Payment.php`)
  - Added `completed_by` and `manual_payment_remarks` to fillable array
  - Added `completedBy()` relationship to Admin model

**Controller Method:**
- **RegistrationController** (`app/Http/Controllers/RegistrationController.php`)
  - Added `markAsPaid()` method with:
    - Authorization check (admin and finance roles only)
    - Validation for required remarks
    - Transaction-safe payment creation/update
    - Automatic registration status update
    - Comprehensive logging
    - Error handling

**Route:**
```php
Route::post('registrations/{registration}/mark-paid', [RegistrationController::class, 'markAsPaid'])
    ->name('registrations.mark-paid');
```

### 3. Frontend Implementation

**Registrations Index Page** (`resources/views/registrations/index.blade.php`)

**New UI Elements:**
1. **"Mark Paid" Button**
   - Appears in actions column for unpaid, non-delegate registrations
   - Only visible to users with `viewAny` payment permission (Admin, Finance)
   - Orange color scheme for distinction

2. **Mark Paid Modal** (`resources/views/components/mark-paid-modal.blade.php`)
   - Reusable component included in registrations page
   - Professional modal dialog with:
     - Registrant name display
     - **Amount Paid** input field (pre-filled with registration amount)
     - **Payment Method** dropdown (Bank Transfer / Online Payment)
     - Required remarks textarea (max 1000 chars)
     - Helpful placeholder text
     - Warning message about action permanence
     - Cancel and Confirm buttons
   - Full page overlay with z-index: 10000
   - Prevents background scrolling when open
   - Keyboard shortcuts:
     - ESC to close
     - Auto-focus on amount field
   - Click outside to close

3. **"Marked By" Column**
   - Shows admin username who marked payment as paid
   - Displays truncated remarks with tooltip for full text
   - Visual icon indicators
   - Shows "—" for non-manual payments

## User Interface

### Mark Paid Button
```html
<button onclick="openMarkPaidModal(registrationId, name)">
    <i class="fas fa-money-bill-wave"></i> Mark Paid
</button>
```

### Marked By Column Display
For manually marked payments:
```
✓ admin_username
💬 Bank transfer reference: TXN...
```

For other payments:
```
—
```

## Access Control

**Who Can Mark Payments as Paid:**
- ✅ Admin role
- ✅ Finance role
- ❌ Secretariat role
- ❌ Executive role

**Authorization:**
Uses `PaymentPolicy::viewAny()` which checks:
```php
return in_array($admin->role, ['admin', 'secretariat', 'finance']);
```

Note: Secretariat can view but the UI restricts the mark paid button to only show for Admin and Finance.

## Workflow

1. **Admin/Finance** navigates to Registrations page
2. Finds an unpaid registration
3. Clicks **"Mark Paid"** button
4. Modal opens with:
   - Registrant's name
   - Amount field (pre-filled with registration amount)
   - Payment method dropdown (Bank Transfer / Online Payment)
   - Remarks textarea
5. Admin enters/confirms:
   - Amount paid
   - Payment method
   - Detailed remarks (payment reference, transaction ID, etc.)
6. Clicks **"Confirm & Mark Paid"**
7. System:
   - Creates/updates payment record with entered amount and method
   - Sets `payment_status` to 'paid'
   - Records admin ID in `completed_by`
   - Stores remarks in `manual_payment_remarks`
   - Updates registration `payment_status`
   - Logs the action
   - **Automatically queues invitation email** for the registration
8. Page refreshes with success message
9. **"Marked By"** column shows admin username and remarks
10. **Invitation email** is sent to the registrant automatically

## Validation

**Required Fields:**
- `amount_paid` - Required, numeric, minimum 0
- `payment_method` - Required, must be either 'bank' or 'online'
- `remarks` - Required, max 1000 characters

**Validation Rules:**
```php
$request->validate([
    'amount_paid' => 'required|numeric|min:0',
    'payment_method' => 'required|in:bank,online',
    'remarks' => 'required|string|max:1000',
]);
```

**Authorization:**
- Only Admin and Finance can access the endpoint
- 403 error returned for unauthorized users

**Transaction Safety:**
- All database operations wrapped in transaction
- Automatic rollback on error

## Automatic Invitation Email

**Feature:** When a payment is marked as paid, an invitation email is automatically queued and sent to the registrant.

**Process:**
1. Payment is successfully marked as paid
2. Database transaction is committed
3. `SendInvitationJob` is dispatched with the registration ID
4. Job processes asynchronously in the queue
5. Invitation letter PDF is generated and emailed to the registrant

**Error Handling:**
- If email queueing fails, payment is still marked as paid
- Admin sees a warning message instead of error
- Logs the failure for manual follow-up
- Admin can manually resend invitation if needed

**Success Messages:**
- Success: "Registration for [Name] has been marked as paid and invitation email has been queued."
- Warning: "Registration for [Name] has been marked as paid, but failed to queue invitation email. You can send it manually."

## Logging

**Success Log:**
```
Registration #123 manually marked as paid by admin #5
Context: {
    amount: 500.00,
    payment_method: "bank",
    remarks: "Bank transfer TXN-12345",
    admin: "john_admin"
}

Invitation email queued for registration #123 after manual payment marking
```

**Error Log:**
```
Failed to mark registration #123 as paid: [error message]

Failed to queue invitation email for registration #123: [error message]
```

## Database Changes

```sql
ALTER TABLE `payments` 
ADD COLUMN `completed_by` INT UNSIGNED NULL AFTER `payment_status`,
ADD COLUMN `manual_payment_remarks` TEXT NULL AFTER `completed_by`;
```

## Testing

### Test Marking Payment as Paid

1. **As Admin or Finance:**
   ```
   - Navigate to Registrations
   - Find an unpaid registration
   - Click "Mark Paid"
   - Modal opens with amount pre-filled
   - Confirm or modify the amount (e.g., 500.00)
   - Select payment method: "Bank Transfer"
   - Enter remarks: "Test payment - Bank ref: TXN-12345"
   - Click "Confirm & Mark Paid"
   - Verify success message mentions email queued
   - Verify "Marked By" column shows your username
   - Verify payment amount and method are saved correctly
   ```

2. **As Secretariat or Executive:**
   ```
   - Navigate to Registrations
   - Verify "Mark Paid" button is NOT visible
   ```

3. **View Payment Details:**
   ```
   - Check "Marked By" column for admin username
   - Hover over truncated remarks to see full text
   - Verify amount matches what was entered
   - Verify payment method is displayed correctly
   ```

### Test Validation

```
- Try to submit without amount → Should show validation error
- Try to submit with negative amount → Should show validation error
- Try to submit without payment method → Should show validation error
- Try to submit without remarks → Should show validation error
- Try to submit with > 1000 character remarks → Should be rejected
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization:** Only Admin and Finance can mark as paid
2. **Audit Trail:** Complete tracking of who marked what and when
3. **Remarks Required:** Forces documentation of payment source
4. **Transaction Safety:** Prevents partial updates
5. **Logging:** All actions logged for audit purposes

## Error Handling

**Scenarios Handled:**
- Missing authorization → 403 Forbidden
- Validation errors → Redirect with error message
- Database errors → Transaction rollback + user-friendly message
- Missing payment record → Automatically created
- Existing payment record → Updated safely

## UI/UX Enhancements

1. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Orange color for "Mark Paid" action (distinct from other actions)
   - Green checkmark icon in "Marked By" column
   - Comment icon for remarks preview

2. **Helpful Hints:**
   - Placeholder text in remarks field
   - Warning message about action permanence
   - Tooltip showing full admin name
   - Truncated remarks with full text on hover

3. **Accessibility:**
   - Keyboard shortcuts (ESC to close)
   - Auto-focus on input field
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Descriptive icons

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add ability to reverse manual payments
- Email notification when payment is manually marked
- Bulk mark as paid for multiple registrations
- Export manual payment records for accounting
- Add payment date override option
- Support for partial payments
